## Story Synopsis

Our main character has recently been contacted by his old friend Hana. She is asking if he had heard from their old childhood friends Naoko and Saoko. Their parents had contacted her about something seeming off with them since their most recent ghost hunting trip (Hana is training to become a shaman and take over the family business of exorcism). And neither of them have been seen after that. Just as he tells her that he has not seen or heard from them at all for a few years, there is a knock at the door. Naoko and Saoko have arrived unannounced at his home.
